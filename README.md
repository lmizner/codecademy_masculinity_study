### Masculinity with K-Means Clustering
The concept of masculinity has played a pivotal role in shaping societal norms, personal identities, and interpersonal relationships. While rooted in cultural and social contexts, the perception of masculinity constantly undergoes dynamic changes that reflect the values and expectations of a given society.

FiveThirtyEight, a popular website known for their use of statistical analysis in many of their stories, researched the topic of masculinity by surveying over 1,600 men. After gathering the insights from the survey, FiveThirtyEight and WNYC studios published the article What Do Men Think It Means To Be A Man?

In this project, we’ll be working with the real dataset provided by FiveThirtyEight from this survey. We have provided two files (with brief descriptions in the Setup pane above) that you will use to find more insights using machine learning.

Begin by looking at the questions and answers gathered in the survey (masculinity-survey.pdf file) and by looking at the major takeaways in the FiveThirtyEight article. As you dive deeper into the analysis of the data and uncover complex patterns and relationships, be sure to consider the ethical concerns and potential biases present in the survey data and machine learning model.
